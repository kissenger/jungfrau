          Hello! We are Emma and Gordon, and we are big fans of spending time outdoors particularly in, on and around the water.  One of our
          favourite things to do individually and as a family is exploring the seas around the British coastline armed with a mask
          and snorkel (or even just a pair of goggles)...

          We launched this site as a way to connect with others who want to find out more about British Snorkelling...

          We had our first exposure to the wonders of British sea life through SCUBA diving, which we loved so much that we both became instructors.
          Then came the challenge of babies, and our water-based forays became more family focussed (sneaky swims on family beach days).
          It was these quick dips with nothing but a pair of goggles which reminded us that you don't need lots of kit to explore the beautiful
          underwater world.  Increasingly we began to pack our mask and snorkel on our family trips, the kids joined in and we were reminded that
          snorkelling is a fun, rewarding and extremely accessible activity that the whole family can enjoy!
