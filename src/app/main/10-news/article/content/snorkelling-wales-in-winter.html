    I had always known that in order to meet the research deadline for our snorkelling in Britain guide book I would need to keep
    exploring snorkel sites all through winter, but I
    recently had to put this into action for the first time ... What was it going to feel like to leave the family behind to snorkel in
    West Wales in the depths of winter?

    I had pencilled in the second weekend of December and I had a good excuse to go to West Wales as I was also due to play in an
    Underwater Hockey* competition that weekend.  As the allotted time approached, I was definitely feeling apprehensive.
    It was my first solo research trip, the forecast was for freezing temperatures and sleet, and all of our friends and family were
    succumbing to the usual end of term coughs, colds etc.  All-in-all I did not have high expectations for the trip!  In my mind a win
    would be making it to Wales, doing some ‘top-side’ research, and then retreating to my room and chaining myself to the laptop to get some
    writing done whilst I had no distractions.

    After a false-start leaving home due to car troubles, I arrived at the first site for a recce in mid-afternoon on the Friday and was
    amazed to be greeted by flat calm sea, sunshine and a deserted beach. I quickly got ready to make sure I got into the water before it got
    dark, and to my amazement I found that the water was crystal clear.  Despite the weather forecast, the conditions were perfect and I had
    a fabulous time exploring the underwater geology, abundent with anemones.

    Despite the picture-perfect conditions the water was of course much colder than I was used to.
    I had gone prepared with many layers of neoprene but still I didn’t want to overdo it; years of swimming through winter has taught me
    how easy it is to get caught in the moment and overstay your welcome.  The golden rule of winter swimming is to make sure you get out
    before you feel cold - this is important due to the phenomenon known as ‘afterdrop’, which describes the continued drop in body temperature
    even after you get out of the water.  This occurs due to the cold layers of skin and muscle causing your core temperature to continue dropping
    even after you are on back on dry land, fully dressed.
    Besides, I still had some photos to take so I didn’t want any post-snorkel shivers!

    Because of this I was super cautious, and I got out after a quick dip then used my olympic-standard speed changing skills to get warm and dry
    as quickly as
    possible (there are few things which I can do more speedily than anyone else but getting dressed on windy beaches and muddy river banks
    is one of them!).  Soon I was wrapped up in my woolly hat and lots of layers, enjoying a cup of tea and taking some pictures as the sun was
    setting, and I was really able to enjoy that post-immersion glow.

    Overall, I could not believe how much I had enjoyed my first foray into winter snorkel research - the light was amazing and the empty beach
    made taking photos so much easier than summer, my Welsh snorkelling experience was really special! Somehow the fact it was winter, the
    shock of having perfect weather and the contrast from the
    craziness of the run up to Christmas made the whole experience feel even more precious. Much to my amazement I now think that the winter might
    be my new favourite way to enjoy snorkelling in Britain!

      * If you haven’t heard of Underwater Hockey, or "Octopush", it is an exciting snorkelling based team game played in a swimming pool.
      It is amazing fun - for more info see <a href="https://www.gbuwh.co.uk/">The British Octopush Association</a> or check out
      some of the many clips on YouTube.
