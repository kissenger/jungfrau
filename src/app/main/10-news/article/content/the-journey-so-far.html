    So here we are in November 2022, racing towards Christmas and even colder weather, and our snorkelling adventure of the summer feels like a
    dim and distant memory.  This morning during my daily dog walk - as I was having my regular panic around carving out enough time from daily
    life to plan in snorkel research and writing - I forced myself to take a pause and think about our Snorkelology journey so far...

  <p class="lead">
    The idea of writing a snorkelling guide came to us in the summer of 2021.  That year we had headed to the Outer Hebrides for our annual
    campervan roadtrip, and were returning home via Skye. The children has tried snorkelling on Barra and were keen to do some more -
    so we were wondering which bit of Skye's beautiful and extensive coastline would be best to head to.
    So we asked Google and came up blank. We looked in the guidebooks and tourist information sites but still nothing.

    Of course we could just pick the nearest bit of water but as seasoned divers, swimmers, snorkellers
    we knew that some places are much better than others.

    The lack of information about snorkelling in Britain got us thinking&nbsp;...
  </blockquote>

  <p class="lead">
    There was information available about wild swimming and diving but not snorkelling, surely this was a missed opportunity as there must be people
    like us who would be interested in this information.  I am not sure if this is a process all people go through but Gordon and I, without fail,
    finish our summer holiday with our heads full of new plans and schemes.  So as we returned from our trip that year, we were super-excited about
    the thought that
    water lovers of the UK needed a guide to snorkelling, to empower all those newly fledged 'wild' swimmers to take the next step and see
    all the beauty lying beneath the surface.   Usually these ideas fall by the wayside once life accelerates back to its usual dizzying pace,
    but for some reason this idea clung on.

    So this time last year we eeked out the time between us in the late evenings to write a book proposal which we duly fired off to a few
    publishers.  The first responses were rejections but then at last we were greeted with a yes and a few months later we
    had a book contract (accompanied by a heavy dose of shock!).

    By June 2022 we had a book contract, and threw ourselves headlong into snorkelling research.
  </blockquote>

  <p class="lead">
    This was in June 2022 - a great time to throw ourselves headlong into
    snorkel research - school holidays, a long van trip to Scotland, the warmest summer we have had for decades, it was all working well.
  </p>

  <p class="lead">
    But now here we are in November again, it is getting chilly, research (involving long stints in the sea armed with the camera) or
    multiple dips a day is harder to achieve due to both the variable weather and the fact that I am a naturally chilly person.
    So today's job is getting my head around what "winter research" looks like - how to fit it in around family life,
    how to translate our summer snorkelling trip format into a version which works with the weather and the chillier sea.
    Obviously, the other winter job is sitting in my woolly jumper and slippers writing about all we saw over the summer - I
    will definitely be doing a lot of that but we can't afford to press pause on the site finding/photography with a midpoint book
    deadline looming.
