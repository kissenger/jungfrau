              Let's face it, we don't live in the tropics -
              but don't let that put you off!  In the summer the water temperature can reach a toasty 20&deg;C
              and this is the sort of temperature that some people can tolerate without a wetsuit.
              However, away from the summer, sea temperatures can get much colder and you will probably need a wetsuit
              to protect you from the elements if you want to be a year-round snorkeller. The amount of neoprene you need tends to depend
              on your own physiology and how long you intend to stay in the water.

              We have been diving, snorkelling and swimming around Britain for 30 years, and the emphatic response is YES!  British
              waters are teeming with marine life.  We have large mammals like seals and dolphins, large fish like sunfish and wrasse,
              along with a wealth of smaller critters (our favourite is the Tompot Blenny!)  You do have to look a bit harder than on
              a tropical reef, but that game of hide-and-seek is part of the enjoyment.  It doesn't take long before you learn where to find
              your favourites and the reward is enormous!

              Snorkelling, like any water-based activity, comes with risks but there are many
              common-sense things we can do to enjoy the marine environment safely. Number one on our list will always be: <i> never
              snorkel alone</i>.  It's so important that you have someone to look out for you, even if they stay on the shore.  Be aware
              of your knowledge and experience level and seek advice from locals or experts as necessary.

              Britain's coastline is rich and diverse, and you can find marine life almost anywhere.  The locations most abundant with life tend
              to be those with rocky seabed with healthy currents: enough to bring nutrients but not too strong that fauna cannot hold on.
              Rocky areas are a great place to find marine life as it provides a perfect habitat for all kinds of critters - especially
              when those rocks are covered with seaweed (often kelp).  Anywhere you can see rocks or kelp from the surface is likely to
              be a good snorkel site, just make sure you check out the tides and currents before you pop in.

              Yes, it is a bit of a tongue-twister!  But we wanted a made-up name so it would be easy to find a domain name.  We recommend
              thinking of it as a compound of 'snorkel' and the ending '-ology'.

              Start small and build up your experience slowly - always stay in your comfort zone - and in no time you'll be
              a snorkelling expert!  Snorkelling is super easy, and the best things to see are often in the shallowest, most sheltered
              locations.  Rockpooling is the perfect way to start your adventures - you just need a mask and you can work up from there...
