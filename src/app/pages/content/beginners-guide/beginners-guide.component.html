    <h2>Beginner's guide to snorkelling in Britain</h2>

    <p>
      Snorkelling is defined by the oxford english dictionary as “the sport or activity of swimming underwater with a snorkel”.
      In practice, snorkelling provides an easy first step to safety explore the fascinating marine environment around us with
      a minimum of basic kit, and in a way that is suitable for all the family. The use of a diving mask and snorkel allows you
      to see and breathe with your face in the water, opening up a hidden world of sea dwelling critters that are usually the
      domain of divers.

      But snorkelling’s only for warmer climes, right?  Wrong!  There are some great places to snorkel around Britain and the UK, and
      plenty of marine-life to see for those willing to brave the colder waters.  Britain has some of the largest tidal ranges in the
      world, and has some fabulous examples of tidal habitats to explore. In this article we will explore some of the reasons to give
      snorkelling a go in Britain.

            In short, no.  Many, many people get hold of a mask and snorkel from beachside shops in their summer holidays and give it a go.
            There is nothing wrong with starting to snorkel in this way, providing the limits of the basic equipment are understood, using
            this to explore rock pools or in standing depth shallows is fine.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, there are good reasons to seek formal training if you wish to progress to explore more deeper, more remote, or more tidal
            sites - you will learn about how to select kit, use proper technique, and crucially how to stay safe in and around the water. The
            main agencies to provide formal training in the UK are
            <app-ext-link link="https://www.bsac.com/uk-diving/snorkelling-in-the-uk/" text="BSAC"></app-ext-link>
             and BSAC.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are also many smaller companies providing snorkelling experiences, and while you probably wont walk away from these with a
            training certificate, you really don’t need one.

            To start with, you only need a snorkel and a mask or goggles to be able to enjoy the undersea environment.  Simply submerging
            your face standing-depth water is enough to start to explore life under the waves.  As you build more confidence, you can add
            fins (flippers) and start to explore in deeper water, ensuring you are always aware of your limits of experience, and progress
            slowly.  However, when you have your whole body in the water, you’ll need to start to think about a wetsuit to manage the Britains
            colder water.

            Like any outdoor activity, snorkelling in Britain is as safe as you make it.  There are many risks involved in snorkelling, no matter
            where you are in the world.  However, although accidents happen, most risks can be mitigated with sufficient experience and care.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Britain we are lucky that we don’t need to worry about sharks - the worst you are likely to come across is a nasty sting from
            a jellyfish, or uncomfortable prickle from a sea urchin.  The biggest risk in the UK is probably from tides and currents. Only
            experience can give you the knowledge to be safe, so extend yourself slowly.

            Britain has no shortage of fantastic places to go snorkelling, but there are some sites that are more suited to finding abundant
            marine life than others.  In general look for rocky locations with lots of seaweeds - these will tend to provide the nutrients
            and natural safety to attract a broad range of marine life.  If you are new to snorkelling, we would recommend starting off by
            finding larger rock pools to explore with a snorkel (the term ‘snorkpooling’ has recently been coined to describe this
            activity), or the sheltered shallows of a cove or harbor.
          </p>

            For budding marine explorers, look out for our new book expected in 2025 that will list many great sites around Britain for
            beginners to experienced snorkellers.

            Crabs. There are more than 50 species of crabs living in our coastal waters, and it’s likely that one of your first
            encounters will be with a crab.  Beyond that, it depends where you are snorkelling, and how lucky you are!  With a
            bit of luck you should see starfish, anemones, gobies, blennies (our favourite is the Tompot Blenny <link>), jellyfish,
            lots of seaweeds and wracks.  With more time in the water, or if you are very lucky, you could see cuttlefish, scorpionfish,
            dogfish or even an octopus.  Check out our instagram feed, and some of those that we follow, to see some photos.
            Beyond sealife, there are also the many fascinating shipwrecks that litter our coastlines.
