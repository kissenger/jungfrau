    <div class="py-2 lead">
      Snorkelling is defined by the oxford english dictionary as “the sport or activity of swimming underwater with a snorkel”.
      In practice, snorkelling provides an easy first step to safety explore the fascinating marine environment around us with a
      minimum of basic kit, and in a way that is suitable for all the family.  The use of a diving mask and snorkel allows you to
      see and breathe with your face in the water, opening up a hidden world of sea dwelling critters that are usually the domain of divers.

          To start with, you only need a snorkel and a mask or goggles to be able to enjoy the undersea environment.  Simply submerging
          your face standing-depth water is enough to to start to explore life under the waves.  As you build more confidence, you can
          add fins (flippers) and start to explore in deeper water.  However, when you have your whole body in the water, you’ll need to
          start to think about a wetsuit to manage the Britains colder water.
